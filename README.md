# Cable Test
Simple Arduino sketch used to test continuity in programming cables. This is used with a specially wired device that has both the full sized PS/2 port and the 4 pin hearing aid programming port.

The device can identify the 3 properly wired Audina cable types as well as any breaks in continuity on the 4 used PS/2 pins.
